          Wikipedia (/ˌwɪkɪˈpiːdiə/ (audio speaker iconlisten) wik-ih-PEE-dee-ə 
          or /ˌwɪki-/ (audio speaker iconlisten) wik-ee-) is a multilingual open 
          online encyclopedia written and maintained by a community of volunteers 
          through a model of open collaboration, using a wiki-based editing system. 
          Individual contributors, also called editors, are known as Wikipedians. 
          Wikipedia is the largest and most-read reference work in history. It is 
          consistently one of the 15 most popular websites ranked by Alexa; as of 
          2021, Wikipedia was ranked the 13th most popular site. It is hosted by 
          the Wikimedia Foundation, an American non-profit organization funded 
          mainly through donations.

          On January 15, 2001, Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger launched Wikipedia; 
          Sanger coined its name as a portmanteau of "wiki" and "encyclopedia."
          Wales was influenced by the "spontaneous order" ideas associated with 
          Friedrich Hayek and the Austrian School of economics, after being 
          exposed to these ideas by Austrian economist and Mises Institute Senior 
          Fellow Mark Thornton. Initially available only in English, versions 
          in other languages were quickly developed. Its combined editions 
          comprise more than 58 million articles, attracting around 2 billion 
          unique device visits per month and more than 17 million edits per month 
          (1.9 edits per second) as of November 2020. In 2006, Time 
          magazine stated that the policy of allowing anyone to edit had made 
          Wikipedia the <q>biggest (and perhaps best) encyclopedia in the world.</q>

          Wikipedia has received praise for its enablement of the democratization 
          of knowledge, extent of coverage, unique structure, culture, and reduced 
          amount of commercial bias, but criticism for exhibiting systemic bias, 
          particularly gender bias against women and alleged ideological bias.
          Its reliability was frequently criticized in the 2000s but has improved
          over time; it has been generally praised in the late 2010s and early 
          2020s. Its coverage of controversial topics such as American politics 
          and major events such as the COVID-19 pandemic has received substantial 
          media attention. It has been censored by world governments, ranging from 
          specific pages to the entire site. Nevertheless, it has become an element 
          of popular culture, with references in books, films, and academic studies. 
          In April 2018, Facebook and YouTube announced that they would help users 
          detect fake news by suggesting fact-checking links to related Wikipedia 
          articles.

          The domains wikipedia.com (later redirecting to wikipedia.org) and 
          wikipedia.org were registered on January 12, 2001, and January 13, 
          2001, respectively, and Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001 as 
          a single English-language edition at www.wikipedia.com, and announced 
          by Sanger on the Nupedia mailing list. Its policy of "neutral 
          point-of-view" was codified in its first few months. Otherwise, there 
          were initially relatively few rules, and it operated independently of 
          Nupedia. Bomis originally intended it as a business for profit.

            One cannot talk about the 60's without showing their  love for the 
            Beatles. The public was gaga over The Beatles.  No one could ever 
            beat the impact The Beatles had over the crowd, making them the best 
            band of all time. They are seen beyond being the ones who redefined 
            music by making a great impact in the world.

            The revolutionary band is one of the most successful band of all time.  
            Their victory is traced back to influence over the audience with their 
            amazing songs like <em>Hey Jude</em> & <em>Don't Let Me Down</em>. The 
            band broke up after the death of their manager which led to several 
            disagreements among the members, breaking hearts of fans, across the 
            globe.  Eventually, as a tribute to the band, the fab four emerged in 
            1997.  Do check out 21 Pilots quotes and [Elvis quotes] after you

          Fandom[a] (also known as Wikia before October 2016) is a wiki hosting 
          service which hosts wikis mainly on entertainment (i.e. video games, 
          movies and entertainers). Its domain is operated by Fandom, Inc. 
          (formerly known as Wikia, Inc.), a for-profit Delaware company 
          founded in October 2004 by Jimmy Wales and Angela Beesley. Fandom 
          was acquired in 2018 by TPG Capital and Jon Miller through Integrated 
          Media Co.

        <p>
          Fandom uses MediaWiki, the open-source wiki software used by Wikipedia. 
          Fandom, Inc. derives its income from advertising and sold content, 
          publishing most user-provided text under copyleft licenses. The company 
          also runs the associated Fandom editorial project, offering pop-culture 
          and gaming news. Fandom wikis are hosted under the domain fandom.com, 
          but some, especially those that focus on subjects other than media 
          franchises, were hosted under wikia.org until November 2021.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main purpose of articles in a Fandom community is to cover 
          information and discussion on a particular topic in a much greater 
          and more comprehensive detail level than what can be found on Wikipedia 
          articles. For example, Spiteful Crow, an enemy character in EarthBound, 
          may have its own article on the EarthBound Fandom, whereas the character 
          may not be considered notable enough for a Wikipedia page. Also, the 
          writing style is mostly directed to those familiar with specific 
          vocabulary and terminology rather than to the lay and general public of 
          Wikipedia; the Harry Potter wiki, for example, is written from the 
          perspective of everything in the franchise universe being real, thus the 
          article about the character Ronald Weasley starts by describing the 
          subject as "a pure-blood wizard, the sixth and youngest son of Arthur 
          and Molly Weasley" instead of "a character in the Harry Potter series".
