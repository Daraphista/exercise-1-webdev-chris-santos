      <h2>1956-1963: Formation</h2>
      <p>
        In November 1956, John Lennon, then aged sixteen, formed a 
        skiffle group with several friends from Quarry Bank High 
        School in Liverpool. They briefly called themselves the 
        Blackjacks, before changing their name to the Quarrymen 
        after discovering that another local group were already using 
        the name. Fifteen-year-old Paul McCartney met Lennon in July 
        1957, and joined as a rhythm guitarist shortly after. In February 
        1958, McCartney invited his friend George Harrison, then fifteen, 
        to watch the band. Harrison auditioned for Lennon, impressing 
        him with his playing, but Lennon initially thought Harrison was 
        too young. After a month's persistence, during a second meeting 
        (arranged by McCartney), Harrison performed the lead guitar part 
        of the instrumental song "Raunchy" on the upper deck of a Liverpool 
        bus, and they enlisted him as lead guitarist.

        Allan Williams, the Beatles' unofficial manager, arranged a 
        residency for them in Hamburg. They auditioned and hired drummer 
        Pete Best in mid-August 1960. The band, now a five-piece, departed 
        Liverpool for Hamburg four days later, contracted to club owner 
        Bruno Koschmider for what would be a 3Â½-month residency. Beatles 
        historian Mark Lewisohn writes: 
        <q>
          They pulled into Hamburg at dusk
          on 17 August, the time when the red-light area comes to life ...
          flashing neon lights screamed out the various entertainment on offer,
          while scantily clad women sat unabashed in shop windows waiting for
          business opportunities.
        </q>
      </p>
      <p>
        Epstein courted the band over the next couple of months, and they 
        appointed him as their manager in January 1962. Throughout early 
        and mid-1962, Epstein sought to free the Beatles from their 
        contractual obligations to Bert Kaempfert Productions. He 
        eventually negotiated a one-month early release in exchange 
        for one last recording session in Hamburg. On their return to 
        Germany in April, a distraught Kirchherr met them at the airport 
        with news of Sutcliffe's death the previous day from a brain 
        haemorrhage. Epstein began negotiations with record labels for a 
        recording contract. To secure a UK record contract, Epstein 
        negotiated an early end to the band's contract with Polydor, in 
        exchange for more recordings backing Tony Sheridan. After a New 
        Year's Day audition, Decca Records rejected the band, saying, 
        <q>Guitar groups are on the way out, Mr. Epstein.</q> However, 
        three months later, producer George Martin signed the Beatles to 
        EMI's Parlophone label.

      <h2>1963-1966: Beatlemania and touring years</h2>
      <p>
        On 11 February 1963, the Beatles recorded ten songs during a 
        single studio session for their debut LP, <em>Please Please Me</em>. 
        It was supplemented by the four tracks already released on 
        their first two singles. Martin considered recording the LP 
        live at The Cavern Club, but after deciding that the building's 
        acoustics were inadequate, he elected to simulate a "live" 
        album with minimal production in <q>
          a single marathon session
          at Abbey Road
        </q>. After the moderate success of <em>Love Me Do</em>, 
        the single <em>Please Please Me</em> was released in January 1963, 
        two months ahead of the album. It reached number one on every 
        UK chart except Record Retailer, where it peaked at number two.
      </p>
      <p>
        EMI's American subsidiary, Capitol Records, hindered the Beatles' 
        releases in the United States for more than a year by initially 
        declining to issue their music, including their first three 
        singles. Concurrent negotiations with the independent US label 
        Vee-Jay led to the release of some, but not all, of the songs in 
        1963. Vee-Jay finished preparation for the album <em>
          Introducing...
          The Beatles
        </em>, comprising most of the songs of Parlophone's 
        <em>Please Please Me</em>, but a management shake-up led to the 
        album not being released. After it emerged that the label did not 
        report royalties on their sales, the licence that Vee-Jay had 
        signed with EMI was voided. A new licence was granted to the 
        Swan label for the single <em>She Loves You</em>. The record 
        received some airplay in the Tidewater area of Virginia from 
        Gene Loving of radio station WGH and was featured on the 
        <em>Rate-a-Record</em> segment of American Bandstand, but it 
        failed to catch on nationally.

        arriving at John F. Kennedy International Airport, 7 February 
        1964 Epstein brought a demo copy of 
        <em>I Want to Hold Your Hand</em> to Capitol's Brown Meggs, who 
        signed the band and arranged for a $40,000 US marketing campaign. 
        American chart success began after disc jockey Carroll James of AM 
        radio station WWDC, in Washington, DC, obtained a copy of the 
        British single <em>I Want to Hold Your Hand</em> in mid-December 
        1963 and began playing it on-air Taped copies of the song soon 
        circulated among other radio stations throughout the US. This 
        caused an increase in demand, leading Capitol to bring forward 
        the release of <em>I Want to Hold Your Hand</em> by three weeks. 
        Issued on 26 December, with the band's previously scheduled debut 
        there just weeks away, <em>I Want to Hold Your Hand</em> sold a 
        million copies, becoming a number-one hit in the US by mid-January. 
        In its wake Vee-Jay released <em>Introducing... The Beatles</em> along with 
        Capitol's debut album, <em>Meet the Beatles!</em>, while Swan reactivated 
        production of <em>She Loves You</em>.

      <h2>1966-1970: Studio years</h2>
      <p>
        Freed from the burden of touring, the Beatles embraced an 
        increasingly experimental approach as they recorded Sgt. 
        Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, beginning in late November 
        1966. According to engineer Geoff Emerick, the album's recording 
        took over 700 hours. He recalled the band's insistence 
        <q>that everything on Sgt. Pepper had to be different. We had 
        microphones right down in the bells of brass instruments and 
        headphones turned into microphones attached to violins. We 
        used giant primitive oscillators to vary the speed of instruments 
        and vocals and we had tapes chopped to pieces and stuck together 
        upside down and the wrong way around.</q> Parts of <em>
          A Day in the
          Life
        </em> featured a 40-piece orchestra. The sessions initially 
        yielded the non-album double A-side single <em>
          Strawberry Fields
          Forever
        </em>/<em>Penny Lane</em> in February 1967; the Sgt. Pepper LP 
        followed with a rush-release in May. The musical complexity of 
        the records, created using relatively primitive four-track 
        recording technology, astounded contemporary artists. Among 
        music critics, acclaim for the album was virtually universal. 
        Gould writes:
        <blockquote>
          The overwhelming consensus is that the Beatles had created a 
          popular masterpiece: a rich, sustained, and overflowing work 
          of collaborative genius whose bold ambition and startling 
          originality dramatically enlarged the possibilities and raised 
          the expectations of what the experience of listening to popular 
          music on record could be. On the basis of this perception, Sgt. 
          Pepper became the catalyst for an explosion of mass enthusiasm 
          for album-formatted rock that would revolutionise both the 
          aesthetics and the economics of the record business in ways 
          that far outstripped the earlier pop explosions triggered by 
          the Elvis phenomenon of 1956 and the Beatlemania phenomenon of 
          1963.

        Two Beatles film projects were conceived within weeks of 
        completing Sgt. Pepper: Magical Mystery Tour, a one-hour 
        television film, and Yellow Submarine, an animated feature-length 
        film produced by United Artists. The group began recording music 
        for the former in late April 1967, but the project then lay 
        dormant as they focused on recording songs for the latter. On 
        25 June, the Beatles performed their forthcoming single <em>
          All You Need Is Love
        </em> to an estimated 350 million viewers on Our World, the 
        first live global television link. Released a week later, during 
        the Summer of Love, the song was adopted as a flower power 
        anthem. The Beatles' use of psychedelic drugs was at its height 
        during that summer. In July and August, the group pursued 
        interests related to similar utopian-based ideology, including 
        a week-long investigation into the possibility of starting an 
        island-based commune off the coast of Greece.
      </p>
      <p>
        In February 1968, the Beatles travelled to Maharishi Mahesh 
        Yogi's ashram in Rishikesh, India, to take part in a three-month 
        meditation "Guide Course". Their time in India marked one of the 
        band's most prolific periods, yielding numerous songs, including 
        a majority of those on their next album. However, Starr left 
        after only ten days, unable to stomach the food, and McCartney 
        eventually grew bored and departed a month later. For Lennon 
        and Harrison, creativity turned to question when an electronics 
        technician known as Magic Alex suggested that the Maharishi was 
        attempting to manipulate them. When he alleged that the Maharishi 
        had made sexual advances to women attendees, a persuaded Lennon 
        left abruptly just two months into the course, bringing an 
        unconvinced Harrison and the remainder of the group's entourage 
        with him. In anger, Lennon wrote a scathing song titled 
        <em>Maharishi</em>, renamed <em>Sexy Sadie</em> to avoid 
        potential legal issues. McCartney said, <q>
          We made a mistake. We thought there was more to him than there 
          was.
        </q>

      <h2>1970-present: After the break-up</h2>
      <p>
        In December 1980, Lennon was shot and killed outside his New York City 
        apartment. Harrison rewrote the lyrics of his song <em>All Those Years Ago"</em>
        in Lennon's honour. With Starr on drums and McCartney and his wife, Linda, 
        contributing backing vocals, the song was released as a single in May 1981. 
        McCartney's own tribute, <em>Here Today</em>, appeared on his Tug of War 
        album in April 1982. In 1984 Starr joined McCartney to star in Paul's film 
        Give My Regards to Broad Street, and played with Paul on several of the songs 
        on the soundtrack. In 1987, Harrison's Cloud Nine album included <em>
          When We Was Fab
        </em>, a song about the Beatlemania era.
      </p>
      <p>
        Harrison died from metastatic lung cancer in November 2001. Paul McCartney 
        and Ringo Starr were among the musicians who performed at the Concert for 
        George, organised by Eric Clapton and Harrison's widow, Olivia. The tribute 
        event took place at the Royal Albert Hall on the first anniversary of 
        Harrison's death.
