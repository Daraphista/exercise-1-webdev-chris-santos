        <strong>The Beatles</strong> were an English rock band, formed in Liverpool in 1960, 
        that comprised John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo 
        Starr. They are regarded as the most influential band of all time and 
        were integral to the development of 1960s counterculture and popular 
        music's recognition as an art form.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rooted in skiffle, beat, and 1950s rock and roll, their sound incorporated 
        elements of classical music and traditional pop in innovative ways; the 
        band later explored music styles ranging from ballads and Indian music to 
        psychedelia and hard rock. As pioneers in recording, songwriting, and 
        artistic presentation, the Beatles revolutionized many aspects of the 
        music industry and were often publicized as leaders of the era's youth 
        and sociocultural movements.
      </p>
      <p>
        Led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, the Beatles evolved 
        from Lennon's previous group, the Quarrymen, and built their reputation 
        playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over three years from 1960, 
        initially with Stuart Sutcliffe playing bass. The core trio of Lennon, 
        McCartney, and Harrison, together since 1958, went through a succession 
        of drummers, including Pete Best, before asking Starr to join them in 1962.

        Manager Brian Epstein molded them into a professional act, and producer 
        George Martin guided and developed their recordings, greatly expanding 
        their domestic success after their first hit, <em><em>"Love Me Do"</em></em>, in late 1962. 
        As their popularity grew into the intense fan frenzy dubbed 
        <em>"Beatlemania"</em>, the band acquired the nickname <em>"the Fab Four"</em>, with 
        Epstein, Martin, and other members of the band's entourage sometimes 
        given the informal title of <em>"fifth Beatle"</em>.

        By early 1964, the Beatles were international stars and had achieved 
        unprecedented levels of critical and commercial success. They became a 
        leading force in Britain's cultural resurgence, ushering in the British 
        Invasion of the United States pop market, and soon made their film debut 
        with A Hard Day's Night (1964).
      </p>
      <p>
        From 1965 onwards, they produced records of greater sophistication, 
        including the albums <em>Rubber Soul</em> (1965), Revolver (1966) and <em>
          Sgt.
          Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
        </em> (1967), and enjoyed further commercial 
        success with The Beatles (also known as <em>"the White Album"</em>, 1968) and 
        <em>Abbey Road</em> (1969). Heralding the album era, their success elevated the 
        album to be the dominant form of record consumption over singles; they 
        also inspired a greater public interest in psychedelic drugs and Eastern 
        spirituality, and furthered advancements in electronic music, album art, 
        and music videos.
      </p>

        In 1968, they founded <em>Apple Corps</em>, a multi-armed multimedia corporation 
        that continues to oversee projects related to the band's legacy. After 
        the group's break-up in 1970, all principal members enjoyed success as 
        solo artists and some partial reunions have occurred. Lennon was murdered 
        in 1980 and Harrison died of lung cancer in 2001. McCartney and Starr 
        remain musically active.

        The Beatles are the best-selling music act of all time, with estimated 
        sales of 600 million units worldwide. They hold the record for most 
        number-one albums on the UK Albums Chart (15), most number-one hits on 
        the Billboard Hot 100 chart (20), and most singles sold in the UK (21.9 
        million).
      </p>
      <p>
        The band received many accolades, including seven Grammy Awards, four 
        Brit Awards, an Academy Award (for Best Original Song Score for the 1970 
        documentary film Let It Be) and fifteen Ivor Novello Awards. They were 
        inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988, and each principal 
        member was inducted individually between 1994 and 2015. In 2004 and 2011, 
        the group topped Rolling Stone's lists of the greatest artists in 
        history. Time magazine named them among the 20th century's 100 most 
        important people.

        No band has influenced pop culture the way The Beatles have. They were 
        one of the best things to happen in the twentieth century, let alone the 
        Sixties. They were youth personified. They were unmatched innovators who 
        were bigger than both Jesus and rock & roll itself: During the week of 
        April 4, 1964, the Beatles held the first five slots on the Billboard 
        Singles chart; they went on to sell more than a billion records; and 
        2000's 1, a compilation of the Beatles Number One hits, hit Number One 
        in 35 countries and went on to become the best-selling album of the 2000s.
